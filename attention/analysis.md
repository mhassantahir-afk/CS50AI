# Analysis

## Layer 8, Head 3

This head seems to capture the relationship between pronouns and their antecedents.  
For example, in the sentence “John went home because [MASK] was tired,” the `[MASK]` token strongly attends to “John,” showing that the model is linking the missing pronoun to the noun it refers to.

Example Sentences:
- John went home because [MASK] was tired.
- The teacher explained the lesson, and [MASK] gave homework.

## Layer 7, Head 2

This head appears to capture adjective–noun relationships. In multiple sentences, adjectives attend strongly to the nouns they describe. This suggests the model is learning how modifiers connect with the words they modify.

Example Sentences:
- The red ball [MASK] away. → "red" attends to "ball"
- The tall man [MASK] running. → "tall" attends to "man"
